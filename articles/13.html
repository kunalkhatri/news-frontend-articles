Murthy is an Indian venture capitalist who wrote a defamatory article in which he alleged that Ms. Bose had lied about the success of her company. The article also questioned her qualifications as a business leader and accused her of fraud. To make matters worse, the false claims were made viral by a number of websites in India. As a result Ms. Bosse has filed a 10 crore rupee defamation lawsuit against Mr.Murthy for violating her ethical rights  and for causing harm to both herself and Zilingo's reputation. <br/><br/>Ms. Bose has taken swift action to protect her good name and that of the company she founded in 2015 alongside co-founder Dhruv Kapoor, despite considerable personal cost to herself due to the time and money required to pursue such legal proceedings.  In response to these events, shoppers from around the world have offered their support with positive statements on social media praising Ms. Bose’s strength & resilience in standing up for herself against Murthy’s unfounded accusations, helping to repair any damage done to Zilingo's reputation as an ethical & innovative business brand leader in retail e-commerce.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/feature/zilingo-ceo-ankiti-bose-files-100-million-defamation-against-mahesh-murthy-for-defamatory-article-3970481' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
