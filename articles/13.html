They have recently filed a lawsuit against Mahesh Murthy, a venture capitalist, for posting a defamatory article about them.<br/><br/>Ankiti Bose and her partner Dhruv Kapoor founded Zilingo in 2015. It is an online marketplace where people can purchase clothing and fashion items. Recently, their company has encountered legal action taken against Mahesh Murthy - a prominent venture capitalist. Murthy shared an article on social media that contained false information about Zilingo and its founders. In response to this, Bose and Kapoor filed a 100 million rupee defamation lawsuit against him.<br/><br/>Ankiti Bose is trying to stand up for herself and the business she has worked so hard to build. The article written by Mahesh Murthy was both hurtful and untrue which is why the lawsuit was filed. It will not be easy to recover the defamation caused by his words but if the lawsuit is successful it could serve as an example to others who might spread malicious rumours online in the future. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Zilingo founders Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor are taking legal action against venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy for writing a defamatory article about them and their business. If their lawsuit succeeds it will help protect them from similar attacks in the future.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/feature/zilingo-ceo-ankiti-bose-files-100-million-defamation-against-mahesh-murthy-for-defamatory-article-3970481' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
