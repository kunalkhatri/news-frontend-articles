The CEO of Zilingo, Ankiti Bose, has filed a complaint to the court seeking $100 million as print damages caused by Murthy's defamatory article. <br/><br/>The lawsuit was brought because of an article that was published in April this year by Mahesh Murthy. In this piece, he discussed the transactions that were done by Zilingo between its various companies located in multiple countries. He then accused of Ankiti Bose or her team of not conducting business ethically.<br/><br/>Due to this false allegation of improper behaviour on Ankiti's part, the CEO decided to file a case against Mr.Murthy for compensation for damages done to the image and reputation of Zilingo and its boss. She is asking for one hundred million dollars as reimbursement henceforth due to these wrong allegations printed by Mr.Murthy. <br/><br/>Ankiti Bose is the boss of an online shopping platform called 'Zilingo', which had some transaction problems between companies based in different countries and Mahesh Murthy had written a false article in April about it which said that her business was not conducted properly, which caused damage to her company's reputation. Consequently Ankitib has filled a court complaint against him seeking one hundred million dollars as compensation due to this defamatory report which falsely accused her of unethical behaviour in business matters</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/feature/zilingo-ceo-ankiti-bose-files-100-million-defamation-against-mahesh-murthy-for-defamatory-article-3970481' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
