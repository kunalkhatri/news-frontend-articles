El Chapo is a dangerous criminal known for his involvement in the international drug trafficking business.<br/><br/>According to the report, his sons are said to have used methods of extreme violence against those who crossed their path, even so far as to feed them alive to tigers in their zoo. It is claimed that they also tortured their enemies by burning them with chilli powder and driving corkscrews into their feet.<br/><br/>These reports were based on interviews conducted with El Chapo's children, along with former members of the Mexico-based criminal syndicate. The syndicate had run a powerful international drug cartel for decades before El Chapo was arrested in 2016 by Mexican authorities and sentenced to life in prison. <br/><br/>Two of El-Chapo’s children – son Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar and daughter Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman Salazar – are believed to have tortured people at a zoo they own in Mexico using extreme measures including feeding humans alive to tigers, burning them with chilli pepper and driving corkscrews into their feet. They also reportedly locked people up in cages full of rats as punishment, according to reports. <br/><br/>El-Chapo's children have been found out committing violent crimes against rivals and those who tried to oppose them. These reports were confirmed by former members of their organisation who experienced similar acts of terror first hand. The shocking acts detailed by these reports prove that El-Chapo's family may not just be involved with drugs, but also cruelty and torture of the worst kind imaginable.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/el-chapos-sons-fed-enemies-to-tigers-tortured-them-with-chillies-and-corkscrews-report-3970790' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
