He was detained and taken into custody as soon as he surrendered himself.<br/><br/>Amritpal Singh is a preacher who ran away from the police for nearly two months after an altercation with neighbouring villagers happened in Late March, 2021 in Punjab. The altercation was between Singh and some villagers who had alleged that supporters of Singh had stone pelted at them. An FIR was filed against him although there were no physical injuries to anyone due to the brawl. Police had initiated an investigation against him thereafter which even saw his name being shifted in the red corner notice list by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).<br/><br/>The Punjab Police had been looking for him since then and wanted to take him into custody for further investigation and questioning concerning his role in the unfortunate incident. However, Amritpal had managed to evade authorities until recently when he finally decided to surrender himself on May 18th at Moga district in Punjab, India. Subsequently upon his surrender, he was detained and taken into custody according to sources close to the scenario. After undergoing questioning he may be booked under relevant sections of Indian law depending on how culpable his role turns out to be after further investigation. <br/><br/>Amritpal Singh is a preacher who ran away from police for two months after a disagreement between him and some villagers that happened at the end of March 2021 in India. Despite there being no physical injuries caused due to this fight, an FIR was registered by the police against Singh who's name even ended up on the red corner notice list by NIA (National Investigation Agency). Singh has now turned himself in and been taken into custody by Punjab Police where he will have to answer questions about the dispute and will be booked under relevant sections of Indian law depending on how much he is found guilty later.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/fugitive-preacher-amritpal-singh-surrenders-before-punjab-police-in-moga-detained-sources-3971450' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
