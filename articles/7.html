Congress Leader Slams Ajit Pawar</h3><p>Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole recently slammed the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Ajit Pawar, for his comments on Prithviraj Chavan. Pawar had said that Chavan should not have taken an oath as a minister if he was unable to handle the post. In response to this comment, Patole strongly criticised Pawar and asked why was he sharing such opinions about his former colleague who was a senior member of the government. Patole further said that, by Pawar making these comments, it is evident that he does not understand the responsibilities associated with the post of minister and thus should not comment on matters which are beyond him.<br/><br/>Nana Patole recently showed his dissatisfaction towards Ajit Pawar's remarks about Prithviraj Chavan's appointment as a minister. He criticized Pawar for sending wrong signals to the people by making such comments and also questioned why was he speaking so negatively about Chavan who had previously served in government along with him. Patole suggested that since Pawar had no knowledge on how to handle ministerial responsibilities, he should try to learn more instead of freely criticizing others.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-chief-nana-patole-slams-ajit-pawar-for-comment-on-prithviraj-chavan-why-did-he-take-oath-as-minister-3970950' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
