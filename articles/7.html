Congress Leader Slams Ajit Pawar</h3><p>Nana Patole, the Maharashtra Congress Chief has spoken against Ajit Pawar, saying he was wrong to have made statements about former CM Prithviraj Chavan. Nana said that Ajit shouldn't have taken an oath of office as minister if he was not in agreement with the policies of the then Chief Minister. <br/><br/>Nana expressed his feelings in a strongly-worded statement and criticised Ajit for running down Prithviraj. Further he added that Congress Party does not encourage such comments and it is inappropriate for someone to badmouth their colleague in public.<br/><br/>Nana asked Ajit why he had taken an oath as a minister if his views didn't match with those of Prithviraj. Nana stated that this showed 'sheer indiscipline' of Pawar and violated the sanctity of his post. Nana concluded by saying that since taking an oath as a minister is an important responsibility, it should not be taken lightly ever.<br/><br/>The Maharashtra Congress Chief, Nana Patole has expressed his displeasure at the comments made by Ajit Pawar about former CM Prithviraj Chavan. Nana has asked what right did Ajit have to become a minister if he disagreed with the policies of Prithviraj and questioned why did he take an oath when his views were different? According to him, this is sheer indiscipline and violation of one's post. He has also reminded everybody that taking an oath is a very serious task and should never be taken lightly at any cost!</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-chief-nana-patole-slams-ajit-pawar-for-comment-on-prithviraj-chavan-why-did-he-take-oath-as-minister-3970950' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
