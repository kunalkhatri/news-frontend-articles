The incident reportedly occurred during a flight from Seattle to Beijing. The young boy allegedly had grabbed the arm of the flight attendant and forcibly kissed her on the cheek,without her permission.The flight attendant felt 'humiliated and disrespected from the boy's actions',reported local media outlets.<br/><br/>On the plane, two crew members were recorded arguing about how to handle the situation. After landing in Beijing, Team Sky's management reported that they escorted the passengers off-board the plane and forwarded it to authorities. Delta Airlines has since confirmed that an ‘uncomfortable situation’ took place on one of its flights in December and that it had been successfully dealt with right away by their crew members. It also confirms that no immediateaction taken against the 10 year-old passenger as he was a minor at the time.<br/><br/>This incident came as an unfortunate surprise to both passengers and Delta Airlines’ employees who are used to dealing calmly with all kind of situations while maintaining their composure aboard flights. Although Delta Airlines acted quickly after hearing about this incident,similar incidentsare unacceptable and should be dealt with more stringent measures in future such as permanent debarment from flying altogether or parental control over minors' behavior aboard flights.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/delta-passenger-accused-of-grabbing-forcibly-kissing-flight-attendant-report-3971143' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
