He never shies away from telling the truth no matter what it takes in terms of penalties and pressure from the government. Everyone must admire such courage and respect for truth. This also motivates many others to speak up their minds without any fear. <br/><br/>In this matter, Rahul Gandhi was asked to vacate a bungalow he was assigned as a Member of Parliament because he said some true things that are unfavorable for some people in power.
