He recently vacated a government bungalow situated in New Delhi (the capital of India) which he was using to stay in. This was done as a sign of protest against the complete injustice that was being done to farmers by the government.<br/><br/>The said government bungalow was renovated for Rahul's use by the then ruling party and several tax-payers' money had been used for the renovation. Nonetheless, Rahul decided to vacate it in order to express his displeasure about the current scenario arising due to unfair practices of the ruling party. He did not want to make use of any amenities given by them if these people are not even bothered about listening and understanding the voices of farmers.<br/><br/>This move made by Rahul Gandhi is admirable â€“ it has gained attention and respect from people all around India. It has showed how much he cares about people who are facing injustice and made it amply clear that he would not compromise when it comes to supporting those who are being deprived of their rights.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-after-vacating-delhi-bungalow-price-for-speaking-truth-3970494' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
