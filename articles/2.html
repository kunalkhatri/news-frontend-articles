He is a radical preacher from Toronto who had been in India for some time now and was taken by the Indian police.<br/><br/>Amritpal Singh opposes the Indian government and promotes a separate state for the Sikh community in India, known as ‘Khalistan’. He and other supporters of this movement, believe that Sikhs need their own country to practice their faith, culture and language. They also consider India's policies towards Sikhism to be oppressive. <br/><br/>In Canada, Amritpal Singh is known as Baba Pal Singh Johal and runs his organisation called The Knowledge Institute Of Guru Granth Sahib. He has several videos on YouTube calling for separate statehood of Khalistan which has made him unpopular with many people including Sikhs who don’t support his views.  <br/><br/>In India he is suspected of delivering provocative speeches at several places to promote separatism and instigate violence against political opponents, which is why he was arrested by the police today. As per reports, he is expected to be charged with promoting enmity between different groups (IPC 153A) and offences related to public disorder (IPC 505). <br/><br/>Amritpal Singh is a prominent leader of the hard line Khalistani movement advocating for a separate state for Sikhs in India by relying on provocative speeches to generating support within the community. Following an investigation into such activities he was detained today by Indian authorities on suspicion of promoting enmity between different groups and inciting public disorder.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-leader-amritpal-singh-5-facts-about-amritpal-singh-radical-sikh-preacher-detained-today-3971463' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
