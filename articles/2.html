Here are five facts about the Khalistani leader. <br/><br/>1. Amritpal Singh is a preacher who promotes the idea of Khalistan, a separate Sikh nation, for India's Sikh minority. He has been advocating for and preaching about this since the early 2000s. <br/><br/>2. In recent times, he has become more visible in the public eye and taken part in demonstrations seeking to gain support for his Khalistani views. He also leads a group known as "Sikhs for Justice", which campaigns for independence from India for Punjab. <br/><br/>3. Amritpal Singh was detained today on charges of inciting violence and disturbing public order during a protest he had been leading against an Indian government ban on religious conversions earlier in August 2020. <br/><br/>4. He has a history of controversial statements, including suggesting that Indian forces be chased out of Punjab to pave way towards Khalistan movement during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns earlier this year. <br/><br/>5. His arrest has caused uproar amongst supporters online who say it is incredibly unfair as they are only advocating peacefully and not engaging in violence themselves or inciting people to participate aggressively in their protests. <br/>Today, a radical Sikh preacher by the name of Amritpal Singh was detained by authorities for allegedly stirring up trouble with his pro-Khalistani movement speeches and demonstrations against religious conversions ban imposed by Indian government recently in August 2020 . He belongs to a group called 'Sikhs for Justice' which agitates for independence from India for Punjab .Apart from this mission ,Amritpal's speeches had created controversies many times before due to provocative texts like chiding Indian forces out of Punjab paving way towards Khalistan's victory during pandemic lockdowns ,earlier this year .However , today's capture led to stir in his sympathizers on social media platform claiming unjustified treatment as they only support peacefully without instigating brutality .</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-leader-amritpal-singh-5-facts-about-amritpal-singh-radical-sikh-preacher-detained-today-3971463' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
