Congress Leader Slams Ajit Pawar</h3><p>Maharashtra Congress Chief Nana Patole has criticised Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, for his comment on former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan. He asked why Ajit Pawar had taken an oath as a minister if he was not happy with Chavan. <br/><br/>Nana Patole, the head of Maharashtra Congress, was unhappy with Ajit Pawarâ€™s statement about Prithviraj Chavan who had served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 2010 to 2014. Nana Patole said that the statement was an affront to the previous Chief Minister and sought to know why Pawar took pledge as a minister if he was not happy with Chavan's work. <br/><br/>Nana Patole felt that it was unfair for Ajit Pawar to speak ill of somebody who worked hard in his position and asked Pawar why he took an oath as a minister if he didn't agree with Chavan's work. He further suggested that since Ajit Pawar had taken an oath as a minister he should have respected it and done justice to Prithviraj Chavan's efforts.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-chief-nana-patole-slams-ajit-pawar-for-comment-on-prithviraj-chavan-why-did-he-take-oath-as-minister-3970950' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
