Congress Leader Slams Ajit Pawar</h3><p>Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole criticised Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar for his comments on former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.<br/><br/>Nana Patole, the president of the Maharashtra unit of the Indian National Congress, accused NCP leader Ajit Pawar of insulting Prithviraj Chavan, former Chief Minister of Maharashtra State. He said that instead of 'casting aspersions' on Prithviraj Chavan's tenure as Chief Minister, Ajit Pawar should answer why he took oath as minister in the BJP-led government earlier this year.<br/><br/>Nana Patole asserted that Chavan had managed to handle various difficult situations as chief minister and questioned what role Ajit Pawar had played in tackling problems faced by the state when it was under BJP government. The Congress leader asked how could anyone put so much trust in the present Maharashtra government when they (Ajit Pawar and state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil) had exchanged their chairs shortly before forming the government. <br/><br/>Nana Patole criticised NCP leader Ajit Pawar for making negatve comments about Prithviraj Chavan's time as Chief Minister of Maharashtra state. He asked why Mr. Pawar was in a coalition with BJP after taking oath as minister earlier this year, questioning if he could be trusted to tackle current issues. The Congress leader suggested Mr. Pawar should think more positively about his remarks on Mr.Chavans leadership instead and look at what was done to help the people of Maharasthra when both parties shared power in the past</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-chief-nana-patole-slams-ajit-pawar-for-comment-on-prithviraj-chavan-why-did-he-take-oath-as-minister-3970950' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
