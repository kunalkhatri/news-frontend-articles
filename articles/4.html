A teenage girl from Uttar Dinajpur was raped and murdered by two men. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is extremely disturbed over the incident and has criticised the ruling Trinamool party for trying to dilute the evidence in the case.<br/><br/>The 16-year-old girl had gone missing on January 17th in Raiganj, and her body was found two days later. The police are investigating into her brutal murder, but according to BJP, the investigation has not been conducted properly by the Trinamool party. They have alleged that top officials of the state government have tried to tamper with the evidence in order to save those responsible for this heinous crime. <br/><br/>The two accused have been arrested after being identified by an eyewitness and are currently in jail under judicial custody. Their families have also been charged with attempting to destroy evidence. <br/><br/>Some BJP leaders have also claimed that it was an attempted cover-up and that these criminals should be given a harsh punishment for their actions so that such incidents can be prevented in future. This act of brutality against a young girl has caused deep anguish among many people across India who are deeply disturbed and appalled by this crime. <br/><br/>In West Bengal there's been outrage over a terrible crime against a young adolescent girl who was brutally raped and murdered by two men from Uttar Dinajpur. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strongly condemned this incident, blaming Trinamool party for attempting to hide or change involved evidence so as to shield perpetrators from punishment. The accused have since been apprehended thanks to eye-witnesses and their families brought up on charges of attempting to obliterate pertinent proof material  In order to prevent further atrocity of such nature happening again, severe punishment needs to be imposed on those responsible - a sentiment shared amongst many across all India who are outraged at what occurred.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/west-bengal-uttar-dinajpur-rape-diluting-evidence-bjp-blasts-trinamool-over-bengal-teenagers-rape-and-murder-3970268' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
