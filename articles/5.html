It is said that he provided false information about Satya Pal Malik's speech which compared the Narendra Modi government with Hitler's rule. The false information was allegedly used to defame and demean the Modi government. <br/><br/>Shah's summons to appear in front of CBI has sparked debates across India as he is one of the most powerful politicians in the country. <br/><br/>Home Minister Amit Shah was asked to appear before CBI in order to answer questions regarding claims he made about former Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik. Reports suggest that Shah gave false information claiming that Malik had compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government with Hitler during a speech; however, it later emerged these claims were untrue. This caused controversy around India, particularly as Amit Shah is an influential political leader.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amit-shah-as-cbi-summons-satya-pal-malik-not-for-speaking-against-us-3971001' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
