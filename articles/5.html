Mr. Malik is an experienced politician who had been a part of several other governments in India before. He was summoned to meet an investigating officer at the CBI office in Delhi on Saturday.<br/><br/>The decision to summon him was made after he criticised the NDA regarding the post-Citizenship Act protests throughout India. He said that the BJP-led government failed to gain the trust of people despite having several years in power and that it had only led to more misunderstandings.<br/><br/>The CBI has denied the allegation that Mr Malik was being targeted for criticising the government saying that he was contacted due to certain investigations being conducted against him. It added that it would carry out its investigations into corruption charges as a part of its duty.<br/><br/>Despite this, many people believe that this is an attempt by the Centre to silence voices which speak out against it . This is especially concerning at a time when many people are facing criminal cases for criticising or protesting against their democratic rights being taken away. <br/><br/><br/>The CBI has recently requested to meet with Satya Pal Malik, former Governor for Bihar, due to his criticism about the governing party in India, NDA run by BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). However, CBI has rejected claims saying he was summoned due to investigations surrounding corruption charges rather than criticism against them. Despite this some view this as a means of censorship towards those seeking democracy from their Government as well as those who are protesting against this cause and have faced criminal cases because of it.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amit-shah-as-cbi-summons-satya-pal-malik-not-for-speaking-against-us-3971001' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
