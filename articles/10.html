The test message, which is set to be received by millions of Brits at a certain time, will be sent via SMS (short message service), and it will read 'this is a test of the national warning system'. <br/><br/>The UK government has implemented this system to warn people in case of an emergency. This is the first time that this system has been tested on such a large scale. The purpose of the test is to ensure that people are informed if there is an emergency situation or natural disaster like floods or earthquakes. <br/><br/>This alert system is similar to one that is used in the United States, where text messages can be sent out when disasters occur so people nearby can be informed and follow safety precautions. <br/><br/>Today, millions of people in the UK will receive a text message from their government saying "This is a test of the national warning system". It's an important exercise which helps make sure that everyone in the country is prepared for potential emergencies or disasters. In case of an emergency or natural disaster, this alert would notify them directly so everyone can take steps to keep themselves safe.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-to-test-emergency-alert-system-on-millions-of-phones-today-3971416' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
