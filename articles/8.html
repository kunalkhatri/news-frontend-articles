Meghan stated that going about life in the present moment was hard for her and her family due to the inaccurate reporting by some of the British press.<br/><br/>Meghan Markle is part of a very famous and important family in the United Kingdom called 'The Royal Family'. Prince Harry is Meghan's husband. Recently, Meghan has said something bad about newspapers in Britain - she says they are telling lies about her and her family. This has made it hard for them to live each day feeling calm and free to be who they want to be. Meghan wants people to know that what they read in newspapers can sometimes be untrue - something she has discovered personally over the past few months.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/going-about-life-in-the-present-meghan-markle-slams-uk-media-reports-3971390' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
