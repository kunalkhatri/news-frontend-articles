She also said that being a public figure has its challenges but regardless of everything, she and Harry are committed to living life in the present. <br/><br/>Meghan went on further to encourage young people to be kind and respectful to one another and the importance of speaking out when you witness anything wrong around you. She said that it taught her resilience even though it was difficult because everybody was working to put a spin on her own story. <br/><br/>Prince Harry shared his thoughts that what had happened was wrong because his family had been targeted intentionally by a British tabloid which wanted to manipulate the truth in order to make a profit. He also spoke against trolling online in social media and said that this kind of behaviour simply reinforces a negative cycle all around us but we can break this by spreading love, kindness, care and respect instead. <br/>  <br/>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle recently spoke out against unfair media treatment directed at them in 2020.
