The loss caused their coach Venkatesh Prasad to lash out in frustration. He blamed the LSG players for their lack of skill and tactical awareness, calling them 'brainless'. <br/><br/>Prasad said he was extremely disappointed by the performance of the team, especially after they had put in so much effort into training. To him, it seemed almost like the players had played without using their brains and that they didn't understand the basics of Cricket. <br/><br/>KL Rahul, captain of LSG, disagreed with Prasad's assessment. He said that all the players on his team were passionate individuals and had worked very hard in practice sessions. He also pointed out that there were external factors such as bad weather which affected their performance as well. <br/><br/>However, Prasad wasn't convinced and was adamant about his opinion about ground-level mistakes on part of LSG's players which he believed led to the defeat. His criticism aimed to send clear warning to both junior and senior players and hope for an improved performance from LSG in their up-coming matches. <br/><br/>The Lucknow Super Giants' poor showing made coach Venkatesh Prasad mad. He shouted at them for not trying hard enough or using their brain during their game against Gujarat Titans, whom they lost badly. Although Captain KL Rahul disagreed with him, arguing that even bad weather can contribute to a game's outcome, Prasad believes his team should have done better regardless. His words were intended to inspire LSG members to do more practicing and pay more attention during games so they can turn things around in their remaining matches this season!</p><a href='https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2023/brainless-venkatesh-prasad-blasts-kl-rahuls-lucknow-super-giants-after-shocking-loss-against-gujarat-titans-3970787' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
