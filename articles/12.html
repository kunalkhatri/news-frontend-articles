Former cricketer Venkatesh Prasad was not happy with the performance, and he has reportedly blasted the team for their poor performance.<br/><br/>Venkatesh Prasad, who is an ex-cricketer, coach and selector of Indian cricket team, has criticised the Lucknow Super Giants for their poor performance against Gujarat Titans. He thinks the team did not show enough courage or application to chase down the target. The veteran believes that it was a 'brainless' display of batting by the Super Giants which resulted in their loss and condemned them for it.<br/><br/>This is not the first time that Lucknow Super Giants performance has been criticised by Prasad as they have had two mixed fortunes this season in IPL. This defeat took their tally to four in nine matches, leaving them at seventh position on the points table.
