He had been living there for nearly 15 years. His move has been met with a mixed reaction - some people appreciate him for taking this step and standing up for truth, while others feel that his decision was a 'price he had to pay for speaking truth'. <br/><br/>Mr Gandhi vacated his official residence just days after losing a three-way electoral showdown between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the recently concluded elections. He had promised before the polls that he would vacate his government house if his party suffered defeat. <br/><br/>The government rules provide members of Parliament with official accommodation only till they continue to hold their offices. Thus, Mr Gandhiâ€™s vacating of the place is being seen as an act of keeping one's word as he voluntarily stepped down from all major posts in his party after defeat. <br/><br/>Rahul Gandhi is a respected politician in India who has kept his word to vacate his official residence upon losing an election. He did this despite having lived there for many years before. Many people admire him because it shows he stands by what he says, no matter what the cost is for him.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-after-vacating-delhi-bungalow-price-for-speaking-truth-3970494' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
