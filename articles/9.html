This system will be used in the future to alert people to national emergencies, such as natural disasters or terrorist threats.<br/>This test will help the government assess how well the service works and if there are any key areas for improvement. The test message will read: "This is a TEST of the UK national warning system. No action is required". It is expected that most people will get this message on their mobile phone sometime today. <br/>The UK's emergency alert system is similar to those used in other countries and allows messages to be sent to millions of phones in a single area at one time. This could be seen as an important safety measure for citizens of the UK, especially in times of crisis. <br/>For younger children who may receive this test message, it's important for parents and guardians to explain what this text means, so they don't become concerned or worried as it's only a test message and they don't need to take any action. <br/>Today, the United Kingdom will conduct a test of its emergency alert system which sends out text messages in times of national emergencies like natural disasters or terrorist threats. Most people can expect to receive this message on their phone sometime today - reading "This is a TEST of the UK national warning system. No action is required". This test helps the government check that this service works properly so it can be used when needed in future crises. Parents and guardians should let their children know that this is only a test and no action is necessary from them.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-to-test-emergency-alert-system-on-millions-of-phones-today-3971416' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
