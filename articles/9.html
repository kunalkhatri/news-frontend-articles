Meghan said that going about life as usual was more important than being subject to ‘untrue’ reports.<br/><br/>Meghan Markle has declared that it is more important to go on with life as usual instead of paying attention to untrue reports by the UK media. She and her husband Prince Harry are currently living in Los Angeles, USA and have taken steps away from their responsibilities in the Royal Family. This decision was made due to a lot of criticism from British tabloids which Meghan says is untrue. She also spoke about how all people have the right to build their own future and should be able to without having pictures or stories written about them without permission. Meghan urged people not to get too focused on the criticisim but move forward in leading happy lives without judgement from others.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/going-about-life-in-the-present-meghan-markle-slams-uk-media-reports-3971390' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
