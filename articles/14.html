Union Minister Kiren Rijiju, who is from the Government of India, has commented on the situation. He said it is all a ‘mindgame’ and he refuses to provide his opinion on it.<br/><br/>Rijiju compared the situation to a 'mindgame' and mentioned he would not comment any further. The Collegium Issue is between the Department of Law and Supreme Court. The disagreement has been ongoing since December 2018 without resolution. It surrounds the issue of appointing judges to high courts in India. Rijiju said any comments made might be used against him in court, so he preferred not to comment on this case. <br/><br/>The minds of 10 year olds cannot comprehend legal matters in such detail, but here's an explanation for them: Two important parts of India's government - one which makes laws (the Department of Law) and one which enforces laws (Supreme Court) - have disagreed on something called "Collegium Issue". Union Minister Kiren Rijiju has also been involved in this case and because he doesn't want any comments that he makes to be used against him in court; he won't give his opinion about it. This disagreement has gone unresolved since December 2018 and involves judges being appointed to the High Courts in India.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/collegium-issue-is-all-about-mindgame-wont-comment-law-minister-rijiju-3970637' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
