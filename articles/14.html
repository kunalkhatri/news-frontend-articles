Law Minister Kiren Rijiju recently commented on the issue of collegium and said it is a 'mind game' that he would not comment on. He said that collegium has been functioning since decades in India. <br/><br/>Law Minister Kiren Rijiju was recently asked about his views on the collegium system of appointing judges, which is active in India for many years. To this he said that it is all a "mind game" and refused to comment. <br/><br/>The collegium system is where judges and members of the legal community of a particular country get together to vote on who is suitable to appoint as a judge at the Supreme Court or High Courts, the step above regular courts.. Therefore, the people involved in these discussions need to be extra careful about whom they select for high positions as any kind of mistake can be very costly in terms of man-hours and resources wasted, both for the court and for society as a whole. <br/><br/>Kiren Rijiju's refusal to comment further showed responsibility from him as any further comments on such an important issue could have put him in an uncomfortable position with regards to law proceedings in India. Therefore, it was wise of him to keep quiet instead of involving himself further into this matter.</p><a href='https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/collegium-issue-is-all-about-mindgame-wont-comment-law-minister-rijiju-3970637' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
