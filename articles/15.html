        </div><h3>IPL 2023: KL Rahul Registers Unwanted Batting Record In Loss Against GT</h3><p>IPL 2023 saw the Lucknow Super Giants suffer a loss to Gujarat Titans on Friday. KL Rahul, the Super Giants' captain, registered an unwanted record while batting. He faced 8 dot balls in a row while trying to accelerate the run rate and bring his team back into the game. <br/><br/>KL Rahul is one of the best batsmen of IPL 2023, who was leading his side for the first time this season. He was playing against Gujarat Titans, who restricted him to score just 7 runs with an impressive spell from their spin bowlers. Rahul’s inability to score runs resulted in him facing 8 consecutive dot balls before eventually getting out on the ninth ball. <br/><br/>This unwanted record has stirred a bit of controversy among fans who have hailed Rahul’s batting skill in previous matches but question his judgement in this particular match. The skipper’s poor form has caused enthusiasts to blame him for the loss of Lucknow Super Giants who were otherwise favourites to win the match had it not been for Rahul’s poor batting performance. <br/><br/>On Friday, KL Rahul made an unwanted batting record where he did not manage to score even a single run in eight deliveries against Gujarat Titans in IPL 2023. His team put up a fight but they could not avoid surrendering their lead due to his lack of runs from his bat. Fans and pundits have blamed him for causing their side's defeat and have criticised him for making this uncharacteristic batting display despite being one of the top batters this season so far.</p><a href='https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2023/ipl-2023-lucknow-super-giants-skipper-kl-rahul-registers-unwanted-batting-record-in-loss-against-gujarat-titans-3970994' target='_blank'> Link to original article</a>
